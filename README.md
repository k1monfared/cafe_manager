# Cafe Manager - CSV-Based Inventory Analytics System

A comprehensive inventory management and analytics system that uses CSV files for data transparency, with built-in audit capabilities and interactive dashboards.

## Core Features

- **CSV-First Architecture**: All data stored in auditable CSV files with full transparency
- **Data Integrity Auditing**: Comprehensive validation system to detect discrepancies and inconsistencies
- **Interactive Analytics**: Toggle between consumption, stock levels, and combined views with delivery markers
- **Automatic Consumption Calculation**: `consumption = previous_stock + deliveries - current_stock`
- **Intelligent Forecasting**: 14-day rolling averages with runout predictions and confidence levels
- **Explainable Recommendations**: Detailed reasoning for all purchase suggestions with urgency levels

## üìã Files You Need to Create

You only need to create **3 CSV files** to get started. The system generates everything else automatically.

### File 1: `item_info.csv` - Your Product Catalog 
**What it is:** List all products you want to track with their basic settings.

```csv
Item_Name,Unit,Min_Threshold,Max_Capacity,Lead_Time_Days,Cost_Per_Unit,Supplier,Notes
Coffee Beans,lbs,2.0,50.0,3,8.50,Coffee Roasters Inc,Store in dry place
Milk,gallons,3.0,30.0,1,4.25,Metro Dairy Supply,Keep refrigerated  
Paper Cups,cases,5.0,200.0,7,42.00,Paper Supply Co,Dry storage
```

**How to create it:**
- **Item_Name**: Use the exact same names everywhere (case-sensitive!)
- **Unit**: lbs, gallons, cases, dozen - whatever you use
- **Min_Threshold**: When to reorder (triggers alerts when stock drops below)
- **Max_Capacity**: Maximum you can store (prevents over-ordering) 
- **Lead_Time_Days**: How many days from order to delivery
- **Cost_Per_Unit**: Price you pay per unit
- **Supplier** & **Notes**: For your reference

### File 2: `daily_stock_levels.csv` - Daily Counts
**What it is:** Record your actual inventory counts each day.

```csv
Date,Item_Name,Current_Stock
2025-08-24,Coffee Beans,12.5
2025-08-24,Milk,8.0
2025-08-24,Paper Cups,150
```

**How to create it:**
- **Date**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format (2025-08-24, not 8/24/25)
- **Item_Name**: Must match exactly from your `item_info.csv` 
- **Current_Stock**: End-of-day count (decimals OK: 12.5 lbs)

üí° **Tip**: You don't need every item every day. Only record what you counted.

### File 3: `deliveries.csv` - When Shipments Arrive
**What it is:** Log when you receive deliveries to track supply patterns.

```csv
Date,Item_Name,Delivery_Amount,Notes
2025-08-24,Coffee Beans,15.0,Weekly delivery
2025-08-24,Milk,20.0,Fresh supply from Metro Dairy
```

**How to create it:**
- **Date**: Delivery date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Item_Name**: Must match your `item_info.csv` exactly
- **Delivery_Amount**: How much you received (must be positive)
- **Notes**: Delivery details, which supplier, etc.

### ‚úÖ Getting Started Checklist
1. Create `item_info.csv` with all your products first
2. Start recording daily stock counts in `daily_stock_levels.csv`
3. Log deliveries as they arrive in `deliveries.csv`
4. Upload all three files via the web interface
5. The system calculates consumption, forecasts, and recommendations automatically!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Rule**: Item names must be identical across all files. "Coffee Beans" ‚â† "coffee beans" ‚â† "Coffee Bean"
